Action Bar Profiles
===================

**Please note, updating to 7.0.3-2 deletes all existing profiles.**

Add-on that allows you to setup and quickly switch between different profiles of your action bars. Add-on is very similar to **Action Bar Saver** but uses GUI instead of chat commands.

Also, you can still use the chat command to manage profiles, such as when you use a macro. For example, type **/abp use DK Frost** to activate the profile named **DK Frost**. All available chat commands are listed below.

Chat commands
-------------

* /abp list - shows the list of available profiles
* /abp use *profile name* - activates the profile named *profile name*
* /abp save *profile name* - saves current action bars to the profile named *profile name*
* /abp del *profile name* - deletes the profile named *profile name*
* /abp send *character* - sends current action bars to *character*
