Action Bar Profiles
===================

Add-on that allows you to setup and quickly switch between different profiles of your action bars. Add-on is very similar to **Action Bar Saver** but uses GUI instead of chat commands.

Also, you can still use the chat command to switch between profiles, such as when you use a macro. For example, type **/abp use DK Frost** to activate the profile named **DK Frost**.
